# Homework-1

In this weeks, homework my goal was to replace non semantic elements with semantic elements.
    Below is a summary of all my changes to the HTML doc
        - replaced <div class="header"> with <header> 
        - assigned <nav> element to menu bar
        -replaced <div class="hero"> with <figure> element
        -replaced <div class="content"> with <main>
        -assigned <article> element to the 3 service offerings, allowing all 3         portions to be styled the same 
        -removed class names from these articles
        - assigned a <section> tag to athe sidebar
        - assigned each one of the subsections as <aside>
        - replaced <div class="footer"> with <footer>
        -adjusted indentation and added spacing

    Below is a summary of all my changes to the CSS doc
        - updated original class callouts to refer to new semantic HTML elements
        -consolidated redundant blocks of code
